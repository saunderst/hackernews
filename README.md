# README

This is a clone of the HackerNews main newsfeed page.  The Y logo links back to the cloned page, while all other links connect to their original destinations.  No interactive features such as voting and commenting have been implemented.

One additional feature not present on the original page: the user loads more articles by scrolling to the bottom of the page, rather than clicking a "More" link.
